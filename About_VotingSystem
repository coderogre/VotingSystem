This document describes the voting system.

Does this voting system already have a name?  What are your opinions of it?

This is a voting system I had been thinking about.
Please let me know what your thoughts are, and if this voting system already has a name, what is the name of it?  Thank you for your thoughts.
To describe it, I wrote a description of how a program would be used to implement this voting system.  Here it goes.

Choice is an object that stores the name of a given choice, as a string.
The application will store each distinctly named choice in List<Choice> allTheNominations.
Each user will be stored in List<User> users.

For each user participating in the voting process, they have X desired choices stored in a List of size X called listOfOwnChoices, 
with index 0 being their first and highest priority, and index 2 being their lowest priority.

Users get to vote for any choice/nomination they come up with.
If a choice they want to include is not already in the list allTheNominations, then it gets added/nominated.  
If it's already in the list, then it does not get added again.
After all users have voted, numberOfNominations is calculated as the size of the allTheNominations list.
Then, each user's first choice gets a value of numberOfNominations.
Their second choice gets a value of numberOfNominations - 1 = numberOfNominations - indexOfTheirSecondChoice.
Their third choice gets a value of maxChoiceNumber - 2 = numberOfNominations - indexOfTheirThirdChoice... until they are out of choices.

For the final count, each possible choice gets their values from each voter added up.  Then, the choice with the highest number wins the vote.
The choice with the second highest number wins the second highest vote.

In the event of a tie, this is done a second time but with only the choices involved in the tie.

As an example, lets say we have 6 users, user 0, user 1, user 2, user 3, user 4, user 5

Their choices in order of highest desire to lowest desire is stored in a list listOfOwnChoices.
user [0] (3 choices): {F, U, W}
user [1] (6 choices): {S, E, U, W, H, Q}
user [2] (4 choices): {W, E, H, U}
user [3] (2 choices): {A, F}
user [4] (1 choice) ; {C}
user [5] (11 choices):{R, Y, Q, V, B, H, U, P, W, M, S}

all together, it includes these distinct choices: {F, U, W, S, E, H, Q, A, C, R, Y, V, B, P, M}

Here is how the process goes.

user[0] processes their vote:
F: allTheNominations does not contain F, so allTheNominations gets F added to it.
U: allTheNominations does not contain U, so allTheNominations gets U added to it.
W: allTheNominations does not contain W, so allTheNominations gets W added to it.
end of user[0]'s listOfOwnChoices has been reached.
allTheNominations contains: {F, U, W}, with numberOfNominations = allTheNominations.Count = 3

user[1] processes their vote:
S: allTheNominations does not contain S, so allTheNominations gets S added to it.
E: allTheNominations does not contain E, so allTheNominations gets E added to it.
U: allTheNominations already contains U.
W: allTheNominations already contains W.
H: allTheNominations does not contain H, so allTheNominations gets H added to it.
Q: allTheNominations does not contain Q, so allTheNominations gets Q added to it.
end of user[1]'s listOfOwnChoices has been reached.
allTheNominations contains: {F, U, W, S, E, H, Q}, with numberOfNominations = allTheNominations.Count = 7

user[2] processes their vote:
W: allTheNominations already contains W.
E: allTheNominations already contains E.
H: allTheNominations already contains H.
U: allTheNominations already contains U.
end of user[2]'s listOfOwnChoices has been reached.
allTheNominations contains: {F, U, W, S, E, H, Q}, with numberOfNominations = allTheNominations.Count = 7

user[3] processes their vote:
A: allTheNominations does not contain A, so allTheNominations gets A added to it.
F: allTheNominations already contains F.
end of user[3]'s listOfOwnChoices has been reached.
allTheNominations contains: {F, U, W, S, E, H, Q, A}, with numberOfNominations = allTheNominations.Count = 8

user[4] processes their vote:
C: allTheNominations does not contain C, so allTheNominations gets C added to it.
end of user[4]'s listOfOwnChoices has been reached.
allTheNominations contains: {F, U, W, S, E, H, Q, A, C}, with numberOfNominations = allTheNominations.Count = 9

user[5] processes their vote:
R: allTheNominations does not contain R, so allTheNominations gets R added to it.
Y: allTheNominations does not contain Y, so allTheNominations gets Y added to it.
Q: allTheNominations already contains Q.
V: allTheNominations does not contain V, so allTheNominations gets V added to it.
B: allTheNominations does not contain B, so allTheNominations gets B added to it.
H: allTheNominations already contains H.
U: allTheNominations already contains U.
P: allTheNominations does not contain P, so allTheNominations gets P added to it.
W: allTheNominations already contains W.
M: allTheNominations does not contain M, so allTheNominations gets M added to it.
S: allTheNominations already contains S.
end of user[5]s listOfOwnChoices has ben reached.
allTheNominations contains: {F, U, W, S, E, H, Q, A, C, R, Y, V, B, P, M}, with numberOfNominations = allTheNominations.Count = 15.

-- All voters have cast their ballots --

This is what happens after.
We have that numberOfNominations = 15.  So now we process each nomination's score.
allTheNominations has an integer value called Score for each possible nomination, initialized at 0 for each one.

allTheNominations[0] = F gets calculated as follows:
user[0].listOfOwnChoices contains F in index 0, so allTheNominations[0] += numberOfNominations - 0 = 0 + 15 - 0 = 15
user[1].listOfOwnChoices does not contain F, so user[1] did not vote for F.
